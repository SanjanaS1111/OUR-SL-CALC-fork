# 🚀 DevOps Mastermind Lab

**A collaborative open-source DevOps lab** created by students of the *IBM Simplilearn DevOps Engineer Master’s Program* to learn, build, and showcase real-world DevOps skills.  

---

## 🌟 Vision

The **DevOps Mastermind Lab** is a public, hands-on GitHub organization where **50+ students** collaborate to create a shared repository of DevOps tools, scripts, and workflows — while **practicing real-world GitHub workflows** like branching, PR reviews, and CI/CD pipelines.

This initiative is designed to:
- Reinforce classroom concepts through **practical, team-based work**.
- Build a **public portfolio of contributions** for every student.
- Prepare students for **FAANG-tier DevOps & Cloud roles** with tangible projects.

---

## 🎯 Goals

1. **Practice GitHub Collaboration**  
   - Each student begins with an *Introduction PR*, adding their profile and a small script or command.
   - Learn branching, code reviews, and collaborative Git workflows.

2. **Build a DevOps Cookbook**  
   - Add scripts, Dockerfiles, Kubernetes manifests, Terraform modules, and CI/CD workflows aligned with the course modules.

3. **Capstone-Ready Platform**  
   - Grow into a central hub where we build a **large-scale, end-to-end DevOps project** together.
